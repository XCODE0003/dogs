          <div style="text-align: left;">We have deep historic roots in the dog industry for years in Korea.

          <p><br>{{$settings->name}} INC owns a high-end world class pet shop in South Korea. We have constantly been contacted by interested buyers, and now we have prestigious customers throughout the world. The expansion of our sales channel has increased by extending our office in U.S. Buford, GA (45 minutes north of Atlanta) to provide better support for our clients overseas. Please note that our puppies are located in South Korea at our reputable shop.</p>
          <p>• Our office is for sales and support only. We do not have any puppies for viewing at this office location.</p>
          <p>• We are not a broker or reseller. We own all the puppies provided on the website at our shop in Korea.</p>
          <p>• We are not a breeder. We bring our puppies from the selected number of respected breeders whom we exclusively work with.</p>
          <p>All puppies are between 11-12 weeks of age at the time of video/photo shoot</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #00aaff;">Our Standards</span></h2>
          <p>A very high and strict standards are implemented on selecting each puppy from the litter. We personally visit the breeders and hand select the most outstanding pups. We travel hours to find the most exceptional pup from the breeder that specializes in a single breed; sometimes returning empty handed considering the fact that we could not find ones that qualifies our standards despite the reputable associated breeders we are partners with. Regardless of our stubbornness, the guidelines to our standards excels our reputation and success in the industry.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2><span style="color: #00aaff;">Our Breeders</span></h2>
          <p>We have been working with partner breeders for a long time which ensures us we are supporting the ethical breeder and we can be sure of the size and quality along with the health background of the puppies we bring in.<br><br>They only work with ones that have special relationships and do not let any random people take their puppies. They are not open to the public.<br>This ensures us that we can get the best puppies that are available. We also pay top dollars to get the puppies. By doing so, it costs us lot more to bring the puppy but the breeders do not end up in the situation where they have to start mass producing for living and become a puppy mill. This understanding between us and the breeders help both of our business to provide quality puppies to our customers.</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #00aaff;">Our&nbsp;VET &amp; Care Team</span></h2>
          <p>We have partnership with prestigious veterinarians who cooperate with our respected and reputable breeders who keep all the puppies in excellent health condition. Our care team members have outstanding experiences to provide the best care for our puppies at the shop. Along with our care team, our veterinarians consistently keep our puppies in top notch shape and condition until a guardian receives their puppy.</p>

          <p>Each puppy is handled by caring professionals and are nurtured with love until they find a new guardian. All puppies are up to date on vaccinations including rabies, coronavirus, kennel cough, internal &amp; external parasites.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Our vets closely examine for:</p>
          <p>• Congenital defects that might show signs later as the puppy grows.</p>
          <p>• The test includes, but not limited to ultrasound of the organs and the heart for any defects.</p>
          <p>• Virus caused illnesses such as: Parvovirus, Coronavirus, Canine Distemper virus.</p>
          <p>• Other possible illnesses / issues or defects</p>
          <ul></ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2><span style="color: #00aaff;">Term Teacup</span></h2>
          <p>Teacups are often times associated with sellers bringing their puppies from puppy mills and advertised as quality puppies that won't grow big.<br><br>Teacup is not an official term used by AKC or other Kennel Clubs to describe the size of the dog. We were very considerate when choosing our name and the terms due to this reason. However, we decided to use the term to help general public looking for quality puppies as this is the general term used.</p>
          <p>While searching for the 'Teacup size puppy,' you will find a lot of websites and forums claiming short life span and prone to illness on teacup puppies. This is very true and common issues of ANY puppies that are from puppy mills.</p>
          <p>We are highly against puppy mill puppies and inbreeding which can be main cause of such health issues and the lifespan of the puppy.</p>
          <p>As there are increasing number of scammers online and offline, please make sure to read our “Beware of Scam” page to educate and protect yourself.</p>
