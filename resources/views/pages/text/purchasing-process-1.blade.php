            <li>Please carefully choose a puppy that best suits you and/or your family. Please research the general personality of each breed you are interested. Each breed and each puppy has their own distinctive personality.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>Once the payment has been verified by our sales team, we will reserve the puppy under the purchaserâ€™s name. <span style="color: #799c29;"><strong>The verification must be done within 2 hours.</strong><br><br>
            </li>
            <li>If a deposit was made, the <strong>remaining balance</strong> becomes <strong>due in seven (7)</strong> calendar days. If the remaining balance is not paid, the puppy will become available to other customers and the deposit will be forfeited.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>Once the payment is made in full, we will be arranging the travel date. It'll be an estimate at first, and as we get closer to the date, we will be pinpointing the exact date.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>IF we cannot reach the client for more than 4 weeks <strong>AFTER</strong> all the payments are made, the purchase will be considered as forfeited.</li>
