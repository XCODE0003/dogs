          <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #799c29;"> How long does puppy live?<br><br></span></strong></h3>
          <p>Generally speaking, it really depends on how you take care of the puppy. Our puppies do not come from a puppy mills/farms. All our puppies come from reputable breeders who specialize in each breed. Inbreeding or puppies from puppy mills/farms affects the quality of life and causes shorter lifespan of a puppy due to their environment and heredity. Our puppies are expected to live as long other dogs in the same breed does.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #799c29;"> Does puppy grow in size?<br><br></span></strong></h3>
          <p>Yes. They are living animals and not a toy.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Although we estimate the size and weight of the puppies, it is by no means a guarantee. The way we estimate is based on the parents and the grandparents of the given puppy along with the current size and because of this, the puppy may end up smaller or bigger than what we estimated them to be. Exercise and&nbsp;diet will also affect the size and weight of the dog as in overfeeding the dog to be overweight.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #799c29;">Vets &amp; estimates by the local vet<br><br></span></strong></h3>
          <p>Please check out ‘About Us’ page for how closely each puppy is health monitored before all puppies are sent. All our puppies need to be approved for the travel before they can be booked for the flight.</p>
          <p>When you take our puppy to your local vet, they can be&nbsp;estimated to be much younger as the vets base&nbsp;the&nbsp;size and growth speed based on a typical puppy in the same breed. Since our puppies are much smaller in size, they have a slower growth rate. For example, the growth of permanent teeth, descending of the testicle or when the puppy goes into a heat cycle is often delayed.</p>
          <p>Our videos are posted when the puppy is 3 months of age, and it takes normally 4-6 weeks before the booking can be arranged which makes the puppy at around 4 months minimum before they can travel.</p>
